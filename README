This is a very basic HTTP proxy.  Currently it will create a new
thread for each new client connection and use blocking I/O calls to
get the request from the browser and then get a reply from the server.

Normal proxy usage: ./twproxy
Voting proxy usage: ./twproxy -v

To use the SSL/TLS MITM functionality you will need to generate a
private key and a self-signed certificate.  To generate a key you can
use the following command:

openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048

and for a self-signed certificate using that private key:

openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 1095

For more information about certificates and key, please refer to the
openssl documentation, which is where these examples came from.
